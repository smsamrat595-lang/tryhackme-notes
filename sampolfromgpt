# Room Name: Simple CTF

## Objective
Find the user flag and root flag from the target machine.

## Target Information
IP Address: 10.10.XX.XX

---

## Enumeration

### Nmap Scan
Command used:
nmap -A 10.10.XX.XX

Result:
- Port 21 → FTP (anonymous login allowed)
- Port 22 → SSH
- Port 80 → HTTP (Web server running)

---

## Initial Access

### FTP Enumeration
I logged into FTP using anonymous credentials:
- username: anonymous
- password: anonymous

Found a text file which contained a username hint.

---

## Web Enumeration
Visited the website on port 80.

Used directory brute force:
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.XX.XX -w common.txt

Found:
- /admin directory

Inside the admin page, there was a login form.

---

## Exploitation

### Brute Force Attack
Using the username from FTP, I used Hydra to brute force SSH.

Command:
hydra -l user -P rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.XX.XX

Successfully logged in via SSH.

---

## User Flag
After login:
cat user.txt

User flag found ✔️  
(Flag hidden for ethical reasons)

---

## Privilege Escalation

Checked sudo permissions:
sudo -l

User was allowed to run nano as root.

Using GTFOBins technique, I escalated privileges to root.

---

## Root Flag
After getting root access:
cat root.txt

Root flag found ✔️  
(Flag hidden)

---

## Lessons Learned
- Always check FTP anonymous login
- Enumeration is the most important step
- GTFOBins is very useful for privilege escalation
